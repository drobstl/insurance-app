# Extraction pipeline - manual smoke test checklist

This is the pre-deploy checklist for any change that touches application
extraction. Run through it before `firebase deploy --only functions:ingestionv3`
any time you have modified:

- `src/carrier-prompt-supplements.ts` (any supplement, or the file itself)
- `src/index.ts` (the generic prompt, `CARRIER_FORM_TYPE_OVERRIDES`, normalization, or schema)
- `../../web/lib/pdf/application-page-map.ts` (PAGE_MAP entries)
- `../../web/lib/pdf/render-selected-pages-to-jpeg.ts` (render scale, quality, or strict/tolerant modes)
- `../../web/app/dashboard/clients/page.tsx` (`APPLICATION_TYPE_OPTIONS`, `SHORT_FORM_CARRIER_FORM_TYPES`, or the `parseApplicationFile` path)

## Where the reference PDFs live

`~/Developer/insurance-app-fixtures/` (on Daniel's laptop, NOT in the repo -
they contain real customer PII). One subfolder per `carrierFormType` plus an
`unknown/` folder for the fallback path.

## How to run the checklist

1. Deploy to production (or run the Cloud Function locally via emulator).
2. Open the AgentForLife web dashboard, go to `/dashboard/clients`, click "Add
   Client".
3. For each fixture row below:
   - Pick the dropdown option listed in the "Dropdown label" column.
   - Upload the PDF from the fixture folder.
   - Wait for the extraction job to finish (review_ready).
   - Compare the review card's values against the "Expected values" column.
   - Check the box at left if every expected value matches.
4. Any row with a mismatch = DO NOT deploy. Fix the regression first.
5. Delete the test clients from the dashboard once you're done so they don't
   pollute the real client list.

### "Other Carrier" fallback path (unknown form type)

Dropdown label: **Other Carrier**  •  Form type: `unknown`

This path is critical: it's what agents use for any carrier we don't have a supplement for. The pipeline falls through to the generic prompt with no carrier supplement, no PAGE_MAP (renderer uses first 6 pages, capped), and no deterministic override. The expectation is NOT perfect extraction - the agent will fix things in the UI - but the pipeline MUST NOT crash, must return review_ready with at least insuredName + coverageAmount + policyType, and the carrier name should be whatever Claude reads from the page (agent corrects if wrong).

- [ ] **`Daxton Bryant - MOO Child WL copy.pdf`** (Mutual of Omaha Children's Whole Life, form ICC17L663A - not yet a supported form type. Expected values on the real form: insured Daxton Bryant DOB 2017-09-23, coverage $15,000, Owner Wanda Bryant (Grandparent, DOB 1960-11-26), premium $7.65 monthly Bank Service Plan, signed 2025-02-20 Clayton AL.)
  - Pipeline completes without error: YES
  - review_ready: true
  - insuredName populated: `Daxton Bryant`
  - coverageAmount populated: `15000`
  - policyType: read from form - should be `Whole Life` (Claude will infer from "Children's Whole Life Insurance" header)
  - insuranceCompany: `Mutual of Omaha` (may come back as "United of Omaha" from legal text — either is acceptable on the unknown path since agent reviews)


## When a fixture fails

1. Note which fixture(s) failed and which fields were wrong (screenshot the review card).
2. Do NOT deploy.
3. Diagnose:
   - Wrong field on ONE carrier only? → likely a supplement bug or PAGE_MAP bug for that carrier.
   - Wrong field on MULTIPLE carriers? → likely a generic prompt bug, normalizer bug, or schema bug.
   - review_ready=false on a carrier that used to pass? → supplement told Claude to return null for a field that `evaluateCompleteness` requires.
   - Pipeline error / throw? → check the Cloud Function logs (`firebase functions:log --only ingestionv3:processIngestionV3Queued`).
4. Fix, redeploy to staging if available, re-run the failing fixture.
5. Once green again, re-run the full checklist (a fix for carrier A can regress carrier B).

## Adding new fixtures

1. Drop the PDF into the appropriate `~/Developer/insurance-app-fixtures/<carrier_form_type>/` subfolder.
2. Upload it via the dashboard once with the right dropdown selection. Verify the extraction manually against the source PDF.
3. Add a new checkbox row above with filename + expected values.
4. Commit the updated `TESTING.md`.

## Refreshing expected values

If an intentional prompt/normalizer change alters field shape (e.g. we decide
phone numbers should now include country code), the expected values in this
file need to change in the same commit. That way the reviewer sees "yes, the
expected values are changing, that's the point" and can sanity check.

Never edit an expected value to match a buggy extraction result - that defeats
the whole point of the checklist.

## Known issues / fixtures to revisit

### Brenda Henry (Foresters) - beneficiary is valid, not a form error
The beneficiary "Brenda N Henry" is the insured's daughter (same first name),
so this is a valid beneficiary entry and should NOT be treated as bad data.

### Tim Olwin (Corebridge/AIG, unknown path) - optional edge-case only
The Tim fixture has "New Carlisle" (a city) in the Middle Initial field and is
now replaced in the main checklist by `Francis Hanson AIG copy.pdf`. Keep Tim only
as an optional resilience check for malformed applications.

### MOO Living Promise supplement - confirmed incorrect re: beneficiary grid
The current `moo_icc23_l681a` supplement in
`src/carrier-prompt-supplements.ts` says:
> "The primary ICC23L681A application pages (1-3) do NOT include a beneficiary
> grid. Return an empty array or null for beneficiaries..."

This rule is WRONG. Investigation of 5 separate MOO Living Promise
applications confirms the Beneficiary grid is present and populated on
PDF page 5 (the 3rd image in PAGE_MAP [3,4,5]) on every sample, located in
the "BENEFICIARY (If more space is needed, list on a separate sheet)"
section below the Authorization/Agreement:

| Insured | Primary Beneficiary | Relationship | Contingent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vickie Besozzi | Doug Besozzi | Child | — |
| Leslie Nitteberg | Roy Harison | Sibling | — |
| Kelly Nauert | Donald Nauert | Spouse/Civil Union Partner | Elizabeth Carey (Child) |
| James Drennan | Tori Epperson | Domestic Partner | — |
| Gary Tucker | Sabrina Williams | Child | — |

5 out of 5 have a populated beneficiary. The "return empty array" rule is
making the Cloud Function miss a real field in production. This is a live bug,
not just a fixture quirk.

FIX: update the supplement's beneficiary rule to something like:
"extract the Primary (and Contingent if present) beneficiary from the
Beneficiary section on the 3rd image. Capture name, relationship, and DOB
when written. Only return empty array if the section is actually blank."

IMPACT when fixed: every production MOO Living Promise job going forward will
have the primary beneficiary name extracted. Historical jobs already in
Firestore won't be backfilled; agents would need to edit those manually.
Re-test all three current MOO fixtures (Vickie, Danny Clifton for Term,
Lindsay for MA5981) after the change.

### Danny Clifton (MOO Term Life Express) - insuranceCompany override test
The MOO application body repeatedly uses "United of Omaha Life Insurance
Company" (the legal subsidiary name) while we want Claude to return
"Mutual of Omaha" (the parent brand the override forces). This fixture is
specifically useful for verifying the `CARRIER_FORM_TYPE_OVERRIDES` post-
extraction override is working: even if Claude returns "United of Omaha" from
the page text, the Cloud Function's override should rewrite it to
"Mutual of Omaha" before Firestore write. If that assertion fails, check the
override block around lines 200-240 of `src/index.ts`.

### Kyle Bodnar & Nicole Price - filename coverage doesn't match actual coverage
Both filenames include a number ("CBO 100", "Term 125") that does NOT match
the actual face amount on the form (200000 and 137000 respectively).
Filenames are not authoritative - always trust the extracted value. No action
required, just don't mistake the filename digit for the coverage.
